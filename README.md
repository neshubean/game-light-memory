Submitted by: **Annesha Ghosh**

Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I googled what methods exist, primarily using w3schools website.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I had a lot of difficulties with navigating git in terms of submitting my work. However, currently, I am working on a project in my computer science class and building a version of git, so due to the familiarity I developed with the system I was able to figure out where I may be going wrong and address it accordingly. I broke down the process through which I was uploading and submitting and realized the issue was coming from the fact that I had created a repo initially and then had deleted it due to my laptop glitching at the time and recreated a new repo with the same name, but my desktop app was trying to access and push to the deleted repo, so I created a new repo with a different repo to proceed. I also have been sick for a bit now and before that I had midterms so I wasn't feeling healthy while completing this project even though I was enjoying it so much, so I paced myself accordingly to my health and made sure to take breaks and play with the program at a deeper level when I am feeling healthier. Also, in general, I really valued breaking down every line of code and making sure to at least understand and internalize what I have written.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I am so fascinated by it! I feel like I was always very in awe of how websites worked the way they did, but understanding, even in a more basic form, how a website actually works behind the screens made it so much more approachable and I now have a new avenue I want to explore and understand more deeply. I want to figure out how I can dive deeper and deeper past the fundementals. I am curious, however, as to how the premade functions themselves translate to create what they do on the website interface, at a lower level than the code we are expressing with.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would spend time figuring out how I can maybe create transitions for the pages every time I restart, I would go through the optional avenues as mentioned by CodePath, and I would try to flesh out the functions more (like the random pattern generator) so that rather than generating a new pattern every time the page is refreshed or opened, it would work every time a game ended. Also, I would try to map out how the user performed at the end of the round, and create a best scores table to save scores across multiple rounds.
